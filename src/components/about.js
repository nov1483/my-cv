                    <p>I started getting interested in computers in 2010 when I was 14 years old.
                        In those same years, I assembled my first computer from spare parts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I do self-education.
                        I also like sports, like playing basketball. But usually I write code all day long.ðŸ™‚
                    </p>
                    <p><span className="front">Frontend</span> began to interest me a long time ago, but only recently I got to its deep study. 
                        And recently I completed an 8-month training course at <a href="https://myitschool.by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">My IT School</a>.
                        At the moment I am looking for a job with good, smart and experienced people to learn from them myself and gain experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>My desire to start working on a real project and become part of the IT world!</p>
